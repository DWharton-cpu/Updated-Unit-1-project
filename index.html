        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a UX and UI designer learning how to build exactly what I mockup. I enjoy telling stories and sharing my discoveries about the unexpected. I have made simple websites in the past, but I had to start my life over due to unexpected events. I would love to share what I have learned during re-creating who I am, especially since the things I love have not changed much. One important lesson I realized over the past 3 years of building myself back up, is not to rush. I am sure I will look back on this first assignment with joy in the future. </p>
